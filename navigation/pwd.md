# `pwd`

## Description

The `pwd` command _prints_ the name of the current _working_ _directory_.

It displays the **full path** of the directory you are currently in within the filesystem.

It’s basically like asking the computer _”Where am I right now?”_, helping you confirm your location in the system.

## Example

```sh
pwd
```

```sh
/home/ubuntu
```

In this example, the user is currently in the `ubuntu` directory, which is within the `home` directory, which itself is within the `/` (root) directory.
